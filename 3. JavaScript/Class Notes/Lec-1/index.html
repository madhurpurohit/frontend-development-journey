    <!-- JS is a programming language which introduce logic & interactions in our website. For example we can make calculator app UI with the help of HTML & CSS, but it is not fully functional like for addition, subtraction etc. Without using JS we cannot make it functional. -->

    <!-- In our website the basic structure is made with HTML like human skeleton, visual appeal is given by CSS like human eyes, skin color, hair etc. & JS is the brain of website like human brain which controls the entire human body. -->

    <!-- Adding JS in Internal but after of HTML Code -->
    <script>
      // Print Statement IN JS. For this we can use console.log("msg").
      console.log("Hello Everyone!");
    </script>

    <!-- Adding External JS  -->
    <script src="./index.js"></script>

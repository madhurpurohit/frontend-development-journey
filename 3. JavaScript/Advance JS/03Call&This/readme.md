## ‚úÖ **Point 1: `setUserName(username);`**

### ‚ùì What happens?

You are **directly calling** the function like a normal function call.

### üö® Problem:

In this call, `this` inside `setUserName()` refers to **`undefined`** (in strict mode) or the **global object** (in non-strict mode like `window` in browsers).

So when it tries to do `this.username = username`, it's **not setting `username` on the object being created**, i.e., **not setting on `userOne`**.

> ‚ùå Not recommended inside constructors ‚Äì because `this` won‚Äôt refer to your object (`userOne`).

---

## ‚úÖ **Point 2: `setUserName.call(username);`**

### ‚ùì What happens?

You're calling `setUserName` and explicitly setting `this = username` using `.call()`.

But here:

```js
setUserName.call(username); // <-- username is a string like "DevFlux"
```

So this is like:

```js
setUserName.call("DevFlux");
```

### üö® Problem:

`this.username = username` becomes `"DevFlux".username = "DevFlux"` ‚Äî but **strings are primitives**, so they **cannot hold properties**.

> ‚ùå This also doesn't help. You are setting `this` to a string, not the object you're building.

---

## ‚úÖ **Point 3: `setUserName.call(this, username);` ‚úÖ**

### ‚ùì What happens?

Here, you're using `.call()` correctly. You're calling the function `setUserName` and explicitly setting `this` to the **object being created**, which is `this` inside `createUser`.

```js
setUserName.call(this, username);
```

### ‚úÖ Result:

Now, `this.username = username` actually sets the `username` property on the new object (`userOne`), just like you'd want in a constructor.

> ‚úÖ This is the correct and clean way to reuse `setUserName()` in this case.

## üéØ Why and When to Use `.call(this, ...)`

- Use `.call(this, ...)` to **borrow a function** and apply it to the current object you're working on.
- Common in constructor functions or custom logic where **you want to share behavior across functions**.

### Example:

```js
function greet() {
  console.log(`Hello, I am ${this.name}`);
}

const person = { name: "DevFlux" };
greet.call(person); // Hello, I am DevFlux
```

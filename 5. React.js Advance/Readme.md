## üöÄ Core React Concepts

This section covers my understanding of the fundamental building blocks of React.

- **What is React & Why Use It?**: I've learned that React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its component-based architecture and declarative nature simplify the creation and maintenance of complex UIs.
- **Declarative vs. Imperative**: I understand React's **declarative** paradigm, where you describe _what_ the UI should look like, and React handles the _how_ (the imperative steps) to update the DOM.
- **Virtual DOM & Reconciliation**: I've learned how React uses a **Virtual DOM** to minimize direct DOM manipulations. **Reconciliation** is the algorithm React uses to efficiently update the actual DOM by comparing the virtual DOM with the real DOM.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup & Tooling

A modern web application requires a robust set of tools.

- **Creating a React App**: Explored various methods for setting up a new React project.
- **Bundlers (Vite, Parcel)**: Gained experience with modern bundlers like **Vite** and **Parcel**, which offer a significantly faster development experience.
- **Package Managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun)**: Proficient in using package managers like `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, and `bun` to install and manage dependencies such as `react` and `react-dom`.
- **Modules & Components**: Understood the distinction and usage of JavaScript (ES6) modules and React components, which are the reusable building blocks of a React application.

## ‚úçÔ∏è JSX (JavaScript XML)

JSX is a powerful syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code within JavaScript.

- **Introduction to JSX**: Understood what JSX is and how it gets transpiled into regular JavaScript.
- **Fragments (`<...</`)**: Learned to use Fragments to return multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM.
- **Embedding Dynamic Values**: Mastered embedding JavaScript expressions, variables, and function calls within JSX using curly braces `{}`.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Implemented various techniques for conditional rendering:

  - Ternary Operators: `condition ? <TrueComponent / : <FalseComponent /`.
  - Logical `&&` Operator (**Short-Circuit Evaluation**): For instance, `<p{students.length === 0 && "No Students Found"}</p` will only render the text if the array is empty.

- **Looping in JSX**: Used array methods like `map()` to render lists of elements dynamically.
- **The `key` Prop**: Understood the critical importance of assigning a unique `key` prop to each element in a list. This helps React identify, track, and efficiently update items.
- **ES6 Import/Export**: Differentiated between `default` and `named` exports and imports for modular code.

## üß© Components & Props

Components are the heart of React applications. I've learned how to create and manage them effectively.

- **Props (Properties)**: Used `props` to pass data from a parent component down to a child component.
- **Destructuring Props**: Utilized prop destructuring to write cleaner and more readable components.
- **Passing JSX as Props**: Leveraged the `children` prop and passed JSX as props to create highly reusable and flexible components (e.g., a generic `Card` or `Modal` component).

## üé® Styling in React

I have explored multiple approaches for styling React components.

- **External CSS**: Importing a traditional `.css` stylesheet.
- **Inline CSS**: Applying styles directly to elements using JavaScript objects, enabling dynamic and conditional styling.
- **CSS Modules**: Creating locally scoped CSS for each component to avoid class name collisions.
- **Styled-Components**: Using this CSS-in-JS library to write component-level styles.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Integrating and utilizing the utility-first CSS framework in a React project.

## üñ±Ô∏è Event Handling

Handling user interactions is a crucial part of any application.

- **Handling Events**: Implemented event handlers for user interactions like `onClick` and `onChange`.
- **Passing Handlers as Props**: Passed event handler functions as props to enable communication from child to parent components.
- **Event Propagation**: Understood the concepts of event bubbling and capturing in the DOM.

## üîÑ State & Lifecycle

State makes components dynamic and interactive.

- **React State (`useState`)**: Mastered using the `useState` hook to manage state within functional components.
- **Lifting State Up**: Understood the pattern of "lifting state up" to the nearest common ancestor to share state between sibling components.
- **Derived State**: Learned about deriving state from props and the potential pitfalls associated with it.
- **Controlled & Uncontrolled Components**: Differentiated between controlled (state-driven) and uncontrolled (DOM-driven) components for managing form inputs.

## ü™ù React Hooks

Hooks allow functional components to "hook into" React's state and lifecycle features.

- **Rules of Hooks**: Adhering to the two primary rules: only call hooks at the top level and only from React functions.
- **`useEffect()`**: Performing side effects, such as API calls, subscriptions, or manual DOM manipulations.
- **`useRef()` & `forwardRef()`**: Using `useRef` to access DOM elements directly or to persist a value across re-renders. Using `forwardRef` to pass a ref from a parent to a child's DOM node. In **React v19**, `ref` can be passed as a standard prop.
- **`useId()`**: Generating stable, unique IDs on both the client and server, crucial for accessibility.
- **`useReducer()`**: An alternative to `useState` for managing complex state logic.
- **Custom Hooks**: Creating custom hooks (e.g., `useFetch`, `useLocalStorage`) to extract and reuse stateful logic.

## üìà Advanced State Management & Optimization

As applications scale, state management and performance become critical.

- **Prop Drilling**: Understood the problem of passing props down through multiple layers of components.
- **Context API (`useContext`)**: Using the Context API to share global state across the application tree, effectively avoiding prop drilling.
- **Performance Optimization**:

  - `React.memo()`: Memoizing functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - `useMemo()`: Memoizing the result of expensive calculations.
  - `useCallback()`: Memoizing functions to maintain referential equality, preventing unnecessary re-renders in child components.

## üó∫Ô∏è Routing with React Router

Handling client-side routing in Single Page Applications (SPAs).

- **React Router**: Familiar with the React Router library and its router types, like `BrowserRouter`.
- **Creating Routes**: Defining application routes using `createBrowserRouter`.
- **Navigation (`Link`, `NavLink`)**: Using `Link` for navigation and `NavLink` for styling active links.
- **Nested Routes & `Outlet`**: Creating nested UI layouts using the `Outlet` component.
- **Programmatic Navigation (`useNavigate`)**: Using the `useNavigate` hook for imperative navigation.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Creating routes with dynamic segments (e.g., `/products/:id`).
- **Data Loading (`loader`, `useLoaderData`)**: Fetching data before a route renders using `loader` functions and accessing that data with the `useLoaderData` hook. This is often preferred over `useEffect` for route-level data fetching.
- **Global Loading State (`useNavigation`)**: Creating a global loading indicator by inspecting the state from the `useNavigation` hook.
- **Error Handling (`useRouteError`)**: Gracefully handling routing and loader errors using the `useRouteError` hook.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment & Best Practices

Building a robust and maintainable codebase.

- **Helper Functions**: Organizing reusable logic into helper functions, separate from the component's render logic.
- **Environment Variables**: Managing environment variables (e.g., API keys) in a Vite project using `.env` files and the `VITE_` prefix.

## üåê API Communication with Axios

A crucial skill for modern web development is interacting with APIs. I've learned to use Axios for streamlined and powerful HTTP requests.

- **What is Axios?:** Understood that Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It simplifies making API requests compared to the native fetch() API by providing features like automatic JSON transformation and better error handling.

- **HTTP Methods:** Gained a solid understanding of the primary HTTP methods used for web communication:

  - **`GET:`** To retrieve data from a server.

  - **`POST:`** To submit new data to a server.

  - **`PUT/PATCH:`** To update existing data on a server.

  - **`DELETE:`** To remove data from a server.

- **Creating an Axios Instance:** Learned the professional practice of creating a reusable Axios instance using axios.create(). This allows pre-configuring a base URL, making API service layers clean and maintainable.

- **CRUD Operations with Axios:** Implemented full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality:

  - **Read (GET):** Fetching data from an endpoint using axios.get().

  - **Create (POST):** Adding new data using axios.post(), passing the payload as the second argument.

  - **Update (PUT/PATCH):** Modifying existing data using axios.put() or axios.patch().

  - **Delete (DELETE):** Removing data using axios.delete().

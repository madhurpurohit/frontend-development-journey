## Overview

Welcome to my **Frontend Development Learning Repository**! This repository is a collection of projects, exercises, and experiments I’ve built while mastering modern web development technologies. It reflects my hands-on experience with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and various JavaScript libraries. Each folder and file represents a step in my learning journey, showcasing my growth as a developer.

This repo serves as both a portfolio of my skills and a personal reference for revisiting concepts. I’ve aimed to write clean, modular, and well-documented code to demonstrate my understanding of best practices and problem-solving abilities.

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and structure for web pages.
- **CSS3**: Styling with Flexbox, Grid, animations, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Dynamic functionality, DOM manipulation, and modern JS features.
- **React.js**: Component-based UI development with hooks and state management.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript for scalable and maintainable code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.
- **Other Libraries**: Experiments with tools like [Redux, Redux-Toolkit, React-Routing, Swiper.js, Framer-Motion etc.].

## How to Run the Projects

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/madhurpurohit/frontend-development-journey.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies** (only use this in react, tailwind css, major project & js library directories):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the Project**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   _Note: Basic HTML/CSS code & projects can be opened directly in a browser._

Check individual project folders for specific instructions or requirements.

## Learning Goals

Through this repository, I aimed to:

- Build a strong foundation in core web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS).
- Master React.js for creating dynamic, interactive UIs.
- Leverage TypeScript to write robust, maintainable code.
- Explore modern styling approaches with Tailwind CSS.
- Experiment with popular libraries to broaden my toolkit.

---

## Why This Repository?

This isn’t just a collection of code—it’s a testament to my dedication, curiosity, and growth as a developer. Each code part & project reflects hours of learning, debugging, and refining my skills. I’ve documented my process to demonstrate my ability to:

- Learn new technologies quickly.
- Apply theoretical knowledge to practical applications.
- Write code that’s easy to understand and maintain.

---

## Future Improvements

As I continue to grow, I plan to:

- Add more complex React projects with state management (e.g., Redux, React-TanStack-Query).
- Integrate backend APIs for full-stack experience.
- Optimize performance and accessibility across projects.
- Expand TypeScript usage in larger applications.

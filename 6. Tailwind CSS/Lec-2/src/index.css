 ** We use the @custom-variant directive to define a custom variant that allows us to target elements with the class "dark" and its descendants.

 *! What it does:
 ** It creates a utility class that we can use in our CSS to target elements with the class "dark" and its descendants.
 ** For example, we can use the class "dark:text-white" to set the text color to white for elements with the class "dark".
 
 *todo What happens if we don't use it:
 ** We wouldn't be able to target elements with the class "dark" and its descendants in our CSS, making it harder to style them.
